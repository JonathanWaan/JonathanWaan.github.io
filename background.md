# My Background

I began my research journey in quantitative trading research in 2023, where I worked in both academia and industry on high-frequency trading strategies and option volatility surfaces (using Neural-SDE methods). That experience gave me a strong foundation in coding, mathematics, statistics, and understanding of market/economics, while also teaching me how to communicate results clearly, work under pressure, think critically, and code in high-stakes environments. I was especially proud to have launched two profitable strategies during my one year in industry and I am very grateful for my mentors' guidance.
