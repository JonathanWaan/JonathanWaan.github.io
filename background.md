# My Background

I began my research journey in quantitative trading research in 2023, where I worked in both academia and industry on high-frequency trading strategies and option volatility surfaces (using Neural-SDE methods). That experience gave me a strong foundation in coding, mathematics, statistics, and understanding of market/economics, while also teaching me how to communicate results clearly, work under pressure, think critically, and code in high-stakes environments. I was especially proud to have launched two profitable strategies during my one year in industry and I am very grateful for my mentors' guidance.  

Over time, I realized that academia in this area often leans too heavily on theory, while industry focuses on well-established ideas. I could not find a sustainable middle ground, and in the long run my interests began to diverge. This motivated me to pursue a research direction that combines technical depth with open, impactful problems and a strong sense of community.  

This path led me to artificial intelligence research, where the challenges of evaluating and improving large language models remain unsolved and deeply consequential. Building on my background in probabilistic modeling and engineering, I now focus on AI measurement sciencesâ€”developing principled methods for evaluation, inference, and reasoning. I am excited to be part of a fast-growing community where collaboration, curiosity, and rigorous methods can contribute to building safe, trustworthy, and reliable AI systems.
